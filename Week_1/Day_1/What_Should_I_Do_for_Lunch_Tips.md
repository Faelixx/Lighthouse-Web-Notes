### Tips

Try experimenting witht he comparison operators('<', '>', '===', etc.) on the node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node' command in the command line.

Work on your code iteratively - that means small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'availableTime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript

function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
